      For this project, I chose to work on a crafting video because it's the
      theme that inspired me the most. The video is clear, with different
      visible steps. For the CSS, I used a color like sand for the background
      because it’s soft and it looks vintage and artisanal which I thought would
      go well with the video. The website is quite simple, with clear navigation
      and large buttons so it’s easy to use. I gave the header and footer are
      semi-transparent with a slight blur, which gives a modern look, I tried to
      make it looks like glass. I make sure that the website was responsive so
      that it works well on both computer and phone. In terms of functionality,
      I first placed the play bar above the video since it was previously below
      the video, which I found less pretty. After that, I added the mute/unmute
      button to the right of the play/pause button, giving the user clear
      control over the audio. Then I added a full-screen button to the bottom
      right of the video, and I add the functionality that the video can be in
      and out of full screen by double-clicking. I also implemented the ability
      to click anywhere on the progress bar to advance exactly where you want.
      This gives the user precise control and makes the website intuitive to
      use. Since I choose a crafting video, I found it interesting to put step
      buttons from 1 to 5. When you click on a button, it lights up in white so
      that the user knows exactly which step they are on, and the step buttons
      direct you to a timecode to the next step for the crafting, which gives
      the website a dynamic feedback in real time. This interactive UX ensures
      that the viewer can follow along easily without getting lost, which is
      particularly useful for crafting tutorials where timing is important. I
      also paid attention to accessibility and usability: the buttons are large
      enough to click comfortably, the color contrast between active/inactive
      steps is clear, and the icons are recognizable and clear enough. The
      choice of fonts and spacing makes the text readable without distraction.
      All of these make the experience pleasant and relaxing, like I wanted it
      to be, and is in line with the crafting theme. The media player is now
      more than just a video, it became a guided, user-friendly tutorial.
