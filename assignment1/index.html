        1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
        the experience
      </h3>
      <p>
        The first thing I paid attention to was the bright color, the bubble and
        the text the center in the center and at the bottom. The website is
        quite simple which make it very easy to focus on the things you see.
      </p>
      <h3 class="title1">
        2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
        your discrete actions.
      </h3>
      <p>
        First, I read the text in the center, then the text at the bottom, and
        drew on the screen with my mouse. I clicked on the links in the text in
        the center and it open an other pop up with an other text and other
        link, I did that with around 10 pop up and I even tried to see if there
        was something else, like sound (there wasn’t). Then I clicked the on/off
        toggle, which made all the bubbles appear in the middle of the screen,
        which surprised me because I didn’t expect so many. I moved the bubbles,
        closed some of them, and finally clicked on “extra small,” which made
        all the text bubbles shrink.
      </p>
      <h3 class="title1">
        3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
        with?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The most engaging part clicking on the link in the pop-ups and also
        moving and closing the text bubbles.
      </p>
      <h3 class="title1">
        4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with
        the experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The most common action I did was reading a lot of text at the start and
        closing the pop-ups.
      </p>
      <h3 class="title1">
        5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
        interactive experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I think the primary goal was to create an original experience that
        invites us to click and explore the site to find things that aren’t
        necessarily intuitive or usual on more traditional websites.
      </p>
      <h3 class="title1">
        6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
      </h3>
      <p>
        At first glance, the site looks quite empty, which immediately invites
        us to look at and click on the details like the links in the phrases at
        the center and bottom.
      </p>
      <h3 class="title1">
        7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
        with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
      </h3>
      <p>
        For me, I think this experience is quite short, a few minutes are enough
        to reach the end, you just have to read everything and dig every link
        you can see. As soon as you click the on/off toggle, the pop-up in the
        middle changes to show “The end.”
      </p>
      <h3 class="title1">
        8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
        interacted with over time?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Because we first focus on the pop-up in the middle, we instinctively
        ether close it, read it or open the links. After that, we can draw on
        the background with the mouse or focus on the phrase at the bottom and
        click on the underlined actions, the on/off toggle, and “extra small.”
      </p>
      <h3 class="title1">
        9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
        reference?
      </h3>
      <p>
        This site can reference traditional websites with pop-ups in digital
        media, but it can also be compared to other forms of print media, like
        newspapers, because the text in the bubbles talks about how mobile text
        is more readable on new media than static text.
      </p>
      <h3 class="title1">
        10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        act when engaging with your research experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        For me, this shows that you shouldn’t just focus on digital media but
        also think about other forms of media. So, you need to explore a bit
        further, compare, and stay curious to better understand how the form
        influences the content.
      </p>
      <h3 class="title1">
        11. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        feel when engaging with your research experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I think this shows that you should feel open and curious because that
        way you can discover new things.
      </p>
      <h3 class="title1">
        12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part frustrating?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The most frustrating part of this site is that you don’t know exactly
        where to go or click. There are many things to click on, multiple links
        in each new bubble, and it’s easy to get lost.
      </p>
      <h3 class="title1">
        13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part satisfying?
      </h3>
      <p>
        For me, the most satisfying part of the site is the first discovery,
        exploring the site and realizing it’s more complex than it seems, that
        many buttons lead somewhere or do something. I find this really
        interesting and it makes you want to discover more.
